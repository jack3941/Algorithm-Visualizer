# Algorithm-Visualizer
 Created an Algorithm Visualizer web app using React, featuring real-time animations for pathfinding (Dijkstra, A*) and sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick) algorithms. The interactive tool empowers users to dynamically compare and manipulate algorithms, fostering effective learning and development of algorithmic concepts.
